# Freetrailer-test

The code for the first task in the Freetrailer Job Interview Test.

I implemented the language chooser with the help of the "i18n" package, using seperate files to store the translations and pulling them as needed. The splash screen was implemented by way of the "splash" option in the expo potion of the "app.json" file. 

Testing has been carried out on a Motorola G8 Power android phone and running the program in expo should be as simple as extracting the files, running "npm install" and then using "expo start".
